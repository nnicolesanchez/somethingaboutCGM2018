abstract = {We show how the interplay between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and merger history deter-mines whether a galaxy quenches star formation at high redshift. We first simulate, in a full cosmological context, a galaxy of total dynamical mass M vir = 10 12 M at z = 2. Then we systematically alter the accretion history of the galaxy by minimally changing the linear over-density in the initial conditions. This " genetic modification " approach allows the generation of three sets of $\Lambda$CDM initial conditions leading to maximum merger ratios of 1:10, 1:5 and 2:3 respectively. The changes leave the final halo mass, large scale structure and local en-vironment unchanged, providing a controlled numerical experiment. Interaction between the AGN physics and mergers in the three cases lead respectively to a star-forming, temporarily-quenched and permanently-quenched galaxy. However the differences do not primarily lie in the black hole accretion rates, but in the kinetic effects of the merger: the galaxy is resilient against AGN feedback unless its gaseous disk is first disrupted. Typical accretion rates are comparable in the three cases, falling below 0.1 M yr −1 , equivalent to around 2{\%} of the Eddington rate or 10 −3 times the pre-quenching star formation rate, in agreement with obser-vations. This low level of black hole accretion can be sustained even when there is insufficient dense cold gas for star formation. Conversely, supernova feedback is too distributed to gener-ate outflows in high-mass systems, and cannot maintain quenching over periods longer than the halo gas cooling time.},

@article{Ford2013,
abstract = {We study the physical conditions of the circum-galactic medium (CGM) around z=0.25 galaxies as traced by HI and metal line absorption, using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include galactic outflows. Using lines of sight (LOS) targeted at impact parameters out to 1 Mpc around galaxies with a range of halo masses, we study the physical conditions and their variation with impact parameter b and line-of-sight velocity in the CGM as traced by HI, MgII, SiIV, CIV, OVI, and NeVIII absorbers. All ions show a strong excess of absorption near galaxies compared to random LOS. The excess continues beyond 1 Mpc, reflecting the correlation of metal absorption with large-scale structure. Absorption is particularly enhanced within {\~{}} 300 km/s and 300 kpc of galaxies, roughly delineating the CGM; this range contains the majority of global metal absorption. The different behaviour of low ionisation potential species versus high ionisation potential species can be understood as low ionisation potential species tracing denser areas closer to galaxies, versus high ionisation potential species tracing more diffusely distributed gas. Photo-ionisation is the driver of this trend where lower ionisation potential species decline rapidly with increasing b while OVI and even weak NeVIII show comparatively flat radial dependencies. In addition, collisionally ionised OVI and strong NeVIII trace hot CGM gas when present in higher mass halos at b $\backslash$leq 100 kpc. Lower ionisation potential metals show little temperature dependence with b, while OVI and especially NeVIII trace hotter gas when present at lower b. Larger halo masses generally produce more absorption. These findings arise using our favored outflow scalings as expected for momentum-driven winds; with no winds, the CGM gas remains mostly unenriched, while outflows with constant velocity and mass loading factor show subtle differences.},

abstract = {We introduce a series of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Lstar (M{\_}200 =10{\^{}}11.7 - 10{\^{}}12.3 Msol) and group-sized (M{\_}200 = 10{\^{}}12.7 - 10{\^{}}13.3 Msol) haloes run with the model used for the EAGLE project, which additionally includes a non-equilibrium ionization and cooling module that follows 136 ions. The simulations reproduce the observed correlation, revealed by COS-Halos at z{\~{}}0.2, between O VI column density at impact parameters b {\textless} 150 kpc and the specific star formation rate (sSFR=SFR/Mstar) of the central galaxy at z{\~{}}0.2. We find that the column density of circumgalactic O VI is maximal in the haloes associated with Lstar galaxies, because their virial temperatures are close to the temperature at which the ionization fraction of O VI peaks (T{\~{}}10{\^{}}5.5 K). The higher virial temperature of group haloes ({\textgreater} 10{\^{}}6 K) promotes oxygen to higher ionization states, suppressing the O VI column density. The observed NO VI-sSFR correlation therefore does not imply a causal link, but reflects the changing characteristic ionization state of oxygen as halo mass is increased. In spite of the mass-dependence of the oxygen ionization state, the most abundant circumgalactic oxygen ion in both Lstar and group haloes is O VII; O VI accounts for only 0.1{\%} of the oxygen in group haloes and 0.9-1.3{\%} with Lstar haloes. Nonetheless, the metals traced by O VI absorbers represent a fossil record of the feedback history of galaxies over a Hubble time; their characteristic epoch of ejection corresponds to z {\textgreater} 1 and much of the ejected metal mass resides beyond the virial radius of galaxies. For both Lstar and group galaxies, more of the oxygen produced and released by stars resides in the circumgalactic medium (within twice the virial radius) than in the stars and ISM of the galaxy.},

abstract = {Proximity zone fossils (PZFs) are ionization signatures around recently active galactic nuclei (AGN) where metal species in the circumgalactic medium remain over-ionized after the AGN has shut-off due to their long recombination timescales. We explore cosmological zoom hydrodynamic simulations using the EAGLE model paired with a non-equilibrium ionization and cooling module including time-variable AGN radiation to model PZFs around star-forming, disk galaxies in the z{\~{}}0.2 Universe. Previous simulations typically under-estimated the O VI content of galactic haloes, but we show that plausible PZF models increase O VI column densities by 2-3x to achieve the levels observed around COS-Halos star-forming galaxies out to 150 kpc. Models with AGN bolometric luminosities {\textgreater}{\~{}}10{\^{}}43.6 erg s{\^{}}-1, duty cycle fractions {\textless}{\~{}}10{\%}, and AGN lifetimes {\textless}{\~{}}10{\^{}}6 yr are the most promising, because their super-massive black holes grow at the cosmologically expected rate and they mostly appear as inactive AGN, consistent with COS-Halos. The central requirement is that the typical star-forming galaxy hosted an active AGN within a timescale comparable to the recombination time of a high metal ion, which for circumgalactic O VI is 10{\^{}}7 years. H I, by contrast, returns to equilibrium much more rapidly due to its low neutral fraction and does not show a significant PZF effect. O VI absorption features originating from PZFs appear narrow, indicating photo-ionization, and are often well-aligned with lower metal ions species. PZFs are highly likely to affect the physical interpretation of circumgalactic high ionization metal lines if, as expected, normal galaxies host flickering AGN.},
