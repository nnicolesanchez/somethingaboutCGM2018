By tracing the redistribution of metals in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) via outflows, we show that \ion{O}{6} is a sensitive indicator of supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback. We examine the effects of SMBH feedback on the CGM using a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation \citep[{\sc Romulus25} ][]{Tremmel2017} and a set of zoom-in ``genetically modified'' Milky Way-mass galaxies sampling different evolutionary paths. We compare the column densities of \ion{O}{6} in Milky Way-mass galaxies and compare them with observations from the COS-Halos Survey; contrary to previous simulations which underpredicted the CGM column densities of \ion{O}{6}, these simulations are consistent with COS-Halos observations of star forming galaxies and slightly overpredict \ion{O}{6} in quenched galaxies. We determine that a galaxy's star formation history and overall accretion rate have little effect on the appearance of \ion{O}{6} in its CGM while column densities of \ion{O}{6} are more closely tied to galaxy halo mass and BH growth history. The set of zoom-in, genetically modified Milky Way-mass galaxies confirm that the SMBH acts as the physical mechanism for transporting metals out into its host halo thereby significantly impacting the column densities of \ion{O}{6} found in the CGM.

\section{Introduction} 
\label{sec-intro}


The circumgalactic medium (CGM), the extended region of gas surrounding galaxies out to their virial radii, is richly structured with the by-products of galaxy evolution. Due to its diffuse nature, the CGM remains one of the most difficult regions to observe. Beginning in 2010, targeted observations of the CGM began in earnest due to technological advances like the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Most observations have focused on UV and optical lines, using a variety of methods. COS-Halos is one such survey which uses the light of distant quasars to probe the absorption lines of CGM gas within galaxies in a quasar's line of sight. Other methods include: stacking analyses, which combine hundreds or thousands of spectra to parse out the faint signals of CGM lines \citep{York2006,Peek2015,Steidel2010}; ``down-the-barrel'' spectroscopy, which employs a galaxy's own starlight as the background source for CGM absorption \citep{Martin2006,Bordoloi2011,Rubin2014,Heckman2015}; and emission line maps, which search for the few photons emitted directly by CGM gas \citep{Putman2012a,Hayes2016}. Emission line maps and absorption line studies have also been made in X-ray, and additional X-ray observations by Chandra and XXM have been used to help constrain the extent of the CGM \citep{Nicastro2005}. Through these studies, observers have found the CGM region to be a structurally complex, multiphase medium \citep{Tumlinson2011,Werk2012,Werk2013a,Werk2016,Tumlinson2017}. \cite{Werk2014} show that most of the ``missing baryons'' of galaxies likely reside in this diffuse region, implying that the CGM may play a key role in the growth of galaxies and the build up of their disks. Therefore, it is clear that understanding the CGM is crucial for understanding the complex nature of galaxy evolution and growth. 

Widespread \ion{O}{6} absorption in halos has presented a particularly intriguing puzzle for theorists. COS-Halos finds a correlation between the column densities of \ion{O}{6} out to 150 kpc and the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of their observed galaxies. Higher column densities of \ion{O}{6} are found around SF galaxies compared to their passive counterparts. \cite{Oppenheimer2016} argue that this bimodality arises due to the \ion{O}{6} acting as a proxy for the virial temperature of gas in these galaxy halos. Therefore, more massive galaxies have more of their oxygen in a phase traced by \ion{O}{7} and \ion{O}{8}; thus, the COS-Halos sample show less \ion{O}{6} in their CGM due to the intrinsically higher virial temperature of these massive red ellipticals. In contrast, \cite{Suresh2017} argue that the \ion{O}{6} is built up by SMBH feedback, which can physically modify the CGM via outflows or heat it to the appropriate temperature for ionizing \ion{O}{6}. In both cases, each argument implies an intrinsic link between the CGM and its host galaxy's evolution. 

Additionally, galaxy evolution has been shown to be strongly tied to the evolution of its central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Through relations like the M-$\sigma$ and the bulge mass-BH mass correlation \citep{Ferrarese2000,Mcconnell2013}, recent studies indicate that the SMBH and its host galaxy halo \textit{co-evolve} \citep[][and references therein]{Gebhardt2000,Volonteri2012b,Kormendy2013,Reines2015c}.   It is therefore unsurprising that a SMBH is thought to leave its marks on the CGM. However, the direct mechanisms by which the SMBH impacts the CGM are still debated. 

SMBHs may effect the CGM in a variety of ways. First, feedback from the active SMBH may inject energy into the surrounding material, raising temperatures, and ionizing metals in the gas \citep{McQuinn2017,Mathews2017,Oppenheimer2018}. Additionally, massive outflows of gas from the SMBH may physically push gas out of the galaxy. Some of this gas may end up falling back into the galaxy as part of the ``recycling'' of the CGM \citep{Tumlinson2017}, enriching CGM gas with metals from the center of the galaxy, and further enriching the IGM as gas is expelled from the galaxy halo.  

Cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have become a powerful tool for examining the physics driving the multiphase nature of the CGM \citep{Cen2013,Ford2016b,Oppenheimer2016,Suresh2017,Nelson2018}. Simulators have long been examining the underlying physics of SMBH activity in galaxies; however, recent studies have proven that the observed properties of the CGM are not easily matched and the underlying physics of this region is a fairly new field, ripe for discovery. Most previous studies have underpredicted the column densities of \ion{O}{6} found by COS-Halos  \citep[including the aforementioned studies,][]{Oppenheimer2008,Suresh2017}; however, important strides have started to be made in probing this diffuse region. Using the smooth particle hydrodynamic code GADGET-2 \citep{Springel2005a,Oppenheimer2008}, \cite{Ford2016a} found that the presence of \ion{O}{6} in the CGM likely arises from metals ejected early on in the galaxy's evolution. More recently, \cite{Nelson2018} well-matched the COS-Halos observations using the IllustrisTNG simulations and determined that the amount of \ion{O}{6} the the CGM can depend on a variety of galactic properties including sSFR. In particular, they determine that BH feedback (specifically, their low-accretion, kinetic-feedback mode) plays a crucial role in setting the amount of \ion{O}{6} in the CGM by affecting the amount of metal mass ejected by their galaxy.

We continue this ongoing investigation of the CGM using two sets of simulations: the cosmological volume, {\sc Romulus25} \citep{Tremmel2017} and three ``genetically modified'' variations of an isolated, zoom-in Milky-Way (MW) mass galaxy \citep{Roth2016,Pontzen2016} simulated with and without the implementation of BH physics. Additionally, we compare properties of these simulations with the COS-Halos Survey. Though other observational surveys have examined the CGM around galaxies \citep{Stocke2013,Borthakur2015,Danforth2016}, COS-Halos \citep{Tumlinson2011} remains the best-studied, uniformly-selected sample of isolated, MW-mass host galaxies to-date. Their readily available gas column densities and the galaxy properties in the survey allows us to directly compare with these observations. 

With our set of simulations and these observational comparisons, we examine the effects of both environmental and internal galaxy processes on the physical state and content of the CGM. Specifically, we address:\\
\\
$\bullet$ How the star formation and accretion history of the galaxy co-evolve with the CGM \\
$\bullet$ How SMBH activity imprints itself on the CGM \\
\\
Using these isolated, zoom-in simulations in tandem with the {\sc Romulus25}  simulation, we illuminate the roles that stellar evolution and SMBH feedback play in setting the properties of the CGM of MW-mass galaxies.

In Section \ref{sec-model}, we describe the underlying physics used in our two galaxy samples. Section \ref{sec-results} details our results from examining the CGM in ROMULUS25 and comparisons with the zoom-in galaxies. We discuss these results and their implications for future studies in Section \ref{sec-discuss}. In Section \ref{sec-conclude}, we summarize and offer conclusions.
